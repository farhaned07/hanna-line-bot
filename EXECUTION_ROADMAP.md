# Hanna Execution Roadmap: The "Win Big" Plan

**Strategy**: B2B Pivot (Insurers) via B2C Data Proof
**Goal**: Secure a pilot with a Thai insurer (MTL/Dhipaya) in 6 months.

---

## Phase 1: The "B2B Readiness" Sprint (Weeks 1-2)
*Goal: Make the product legally and technically ready for an insurer demo.*

### 1. 🛡️ PDPA Compliance (CRITICAL)
*   **Why**: No insurer will talk to us without this. It's the first question their legal team will ask.
*   **Action**:
    *   Add "Terms of Service" & "Privacy Policy" acceptance screen at onboarding.
    *   Add explicit "Consent to share data with medical providers" checkbox.
    *   Create a simple `/privacy` web page.

### 2. 📄 The "Doctor Report" Bridge
*   **Why**: Insurers use telehealth apps (MorDee). Hanna needs to feed data into that ecosystem.
*   **Action**:
    *   Create a "Generate Report" button in the LIFF app.
    *   Output a PDF summary: "Glucose Trends (Last 30 Days)", "Adherence Score", "Red Flag Incidents".
    *   *Pitch:* "Patient talks to Hanna daily -> Hanna gives Doctor the summary."

## Phase 2: The "Clinical Proof" Pilot (Weeks 3-12)
*Goal: Generate the data that sells the product.*

### 1. 🚀 Soft Launch (The "Clinical Trial")
*   **Target**: 20-50 diabetic users (friends, family, ads).
*   **Action**:
    *   Onboard users manually.
    *   **Requirement**: Users must log their HbA1c (or estimated glucose) at Day 0.
    *   Run for 90 days.

### 2. 📊 Data Collection
*   **Key Metrics to Track**:
    *   **Engagement**: Daily Active Users (DAU).
    *   **Safety**: Number of "Red Flags" detected (potential hospitalizations saved).
    *   **Outcome**: Self-reported glucose improvement.

## Phase 3: The "Trojan Horse" Sales Push (Month 4+)
*Goal: Sign the first pilot.*

### 1. 🎯 Target Selection
*   **Primary**: **Muang Thai Life (Fuchsia Lab)** or **Dhipaya Insurance**.
*   **Secondary**: **Bangkok Insurance**.

### 2. 💼 The Pitch
*   **Narrative**: "You have MorDee for doctors. You have MTL Fit for steps. Hanna is your 'Digital Nurse' for the 24/7 gap in between."
*   **Proof**: Show the Phase 2 report ("We reduced glucose by X% in our pilot group").
