# Hanna: Strategic Alignment with Thai Insurers

**Based on Market Research (Dec 2025)**

---

## 1. Market Validation: The "Pull" is Real

Thai insurers are actively piloting digital health solutions, proving **market readiness** for Hanna.

| Insurer | Current Initiative | Hanna's Opportunity |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **AIA Thailand** | **"Manageable Diabetes"** with True Digital (MorDee app). Offers free checkups & consults. | **Companion App**: MorDee handles the *doctor visit*; Hanna handles the *daily 24/7 monitoring* between visits. |
| **Muang Thai Life** | **Diabetes Pilot** with Swiss Re & Prenetics. Premium discounts for improved blood sugar. | **Data Engine**: Hanna provides the granular daily data (glucose, adherence) needed to verify "improved lifestyle" for discounts. |
| **Krungthai-AXA** | **"Emma by AXA"**. AI symptom checker & telehealth. | **Voice Upgrade**: Replace/Enhance their text-based chatbot with Hanna's Gemini Live voice interface for elderly users. |

**Key Insight**: Insurers are already paying for this. You don't need to educate them on *why* digital health matters; you just need to show why Hanna is the *better execution*.

## 2. Strategic Positioning: "The Missing Layer"

Insurers have **Telehealth** (Doctors) and **Wellness Apps** (Step counters). They lack **Continuous Clinical Engagement**.

**Hanna's Pitch**: "Telehealth is episodic. Hanna is continuous."

### Alignment with Insurer Goals

#### Goal 1: Claims Reduction (The Money)
*   **Insurer Pain**: A diabetic patient feels fine, skips meds, then has a ฿200k heart attack.
*   **Hanna Solution**: Real-time "Red Flag" detection catches the spike *before* the hospitalization.
*   **Metric**: "Preventable Admissions" (e.g., hypoglycemia shock).

#### Goal 2: Risk Stratification (The Data)
*   **Insurer Pain**: They don't know which diabetic is "controlled" vs. "ticking time bomb" until a claim hits.
*   **Hanna Solution**: Daily risk scoring based on self-reported glucose + mood + adherence.
*   **Metric**: "Risk Segmentation Accuracy" (identifying high-cost users early).

#### Goal 3: Engagement (The Relationship)
*   **Insurer Pain**: Customers only talk to insurers when paying premiums or claiming.
*   **Hanna Solution**: Daily positive interactions via LINE/Voice.
*   **Metric**: "Daily Active Users" (DAU) retention.

## 3. The "Trojan Horse" Pilot Strategy

Don't try to replace their existing apps (MorDee, Emma). **Integrate with them.**

### Recommended Pilot Model
1.  **Target Condition**: **Type-2 Diabetes** (Matches AIA/Muang Thai focus).
2.  **Target Partner**: **Muang Thai Life (MTL)** or **Dhipaya**.
    *   *Why MTL:* They have a dedicated innovation lab ("Fuchsia") and history of pilots with startups.
3.  **The Offer**: "Add Hanna to your existing Diabetes Care program for 6 months."
    *   *Role:* Hanna acts as the "Digital Nurse" between doctor visits.
4.  **Success Metrics (KPIs)**:
    *   **HbA1c Reduction**: The gold standard.
    *   **Medication Adherence**: % of days meds taken.
    *   **Engagement**: Minutes of voice conversation per week.

## 4. Barriers & Mitigations (Adjusted)

| Barrier | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Regulatory (PDPA)** | **Immediate Action**: Implement strict PDPA consent flow. Partner with local legal counsel. |
| **Vendor Risk** | **Action**: Offer a "Sandbox Pilot" (OIC Sandbox) to reduce their compliance risk. |
| **"Does it work?"** | **Action**: Use the B2C soft launch (current phase) to generate a "Clinical White Paper" with real Thai patient data. |
| **Integration** | **Action**: Build simple APIs (CSV export/import first) so they don't need deep IT integration for the pilot. |

## 5. Action Plan Adjustments

1.  **Refine the Pitch Deck**:
    *   *Old Pitch:* "AI Nurse for patients."
    *   *New Pitch:* "Continuous Risk Monitoring for your Diabetes Portfolio."
    *   *Add Slide:* "How Hanna complements MorDee / Emma."

2.  **Product Tweak**:
    *   Add **"Report for Doctor"** feature. Users need to be able to export their Hanna chat history/data to show their MorDee doctor. This bridges the gap.

3.  **Data Focus**:
    *   Ensure we are tracking **HbA1c** (self-reported is fine for now, lab verified later). This is the currency insurers trade in.

**Verdict**: The research confirms we are on the **exact right path**. The market is waiting for Hanna.
