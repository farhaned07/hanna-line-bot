## The One Sentence

> **"10x nurse capacity through supervised AI"**

Everything we build, say, and measure serves this sentence.

---

## What This Means

| Word | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **10x** | One nurse can safely manage 500+ chronic patients (vs. 50 today) |
| **Nurse** | The hero. We make their job easier, not replace them. |
| **Capacity** | Throughput—more patients per nurse, same quality |
| **Supervised** | AI is never autonomous; nurses see and override everything |
| **AI** | Handles routine follow-up; surfaces exceptions |

---

## What We Are

- **Care infrastructure** that extends nurse reach
- **Exception detection** that prioritizes attention
- **Supervised system** with human-in-the-loop

## What We Are NOT

- ❌ A replacement for nurses
- ❌ A medical device that diagnoses
- ❌ An autonomous decision-maker
- ❌ A chatbot ("AI Nurse" is retired language)

---

## Core Value Proposition

| Buyer | Pain | Our Solution |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Hospital Admin** | Nurse shortage (can't hire) | 10x capacity without hiring |
| **Head of Nursing** | Burnout, missed follow-ups | AI handles routine, nurses handle exceptions |
| **Chronic Care Director** | Patients lost to follow-up | 100% coverage through automation |

---

## Key Metrics (What We Measure)

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Patients per nurse** | 500+ | Core capacity multiplier |
| **Response time** | < 30 min for critical | Nurse efficiency |
| **Coverage rate** | 100% | No patient left behind |
| **Escalation accuracy** | > 90% | Only surface what matters |

---

## Language Rules

### Always Say:

- "Supervised care assistant"
- "Nurse capacity"
- "Care coverage"
- "Exception surfacing"
- "Human-in-the-loop"

### Never Say:

- "AI Nurse" (sounds like replacement)
- "Virtual nurse" (regulatory risk)
- "Autonomous" (implies no supervision)
- "Chatbot" (undervalues the product)
- "Diagnose" or "prescribe" (scope of practice violation)

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Thailand has a 35,000 nurse shortage. You can't hire your way out.
>
> Hanna gives each nurse 10x capacity by handling daily patient follow-up—checking vitals, tracking medications, detecting warning signs—then surfacing only what needs human attention.
>
> Your nurses focus on exceptions. Hanna handles the rest."

## The Demo Flow

1. **Show the patient grid** — "Each dot is a patient being monitored right now"
2. **Show a green dot** — "This patient is stable. Hanna is handling follow-up."
3. **Show a red dot** — "This one flagged. Hanna surfaced it. Nurse takes action."
4. **Show the capacity bar** — "One nurse managing 300 patients. That's the multiplier."

## Pricing Anchor

| Model | Price | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Per nurse seat | ฿80-100K/month | Value = 10x capacity = ฿1M+ value |
| Per patient/month | ฿2-3K/month | Matches care management economics |

---

## Regulatory Posture (Summary)

- Hanna is **infrastructure**, not a practitioner
- All clinical decisions by **licensed nurses**
- We **surface**, never **advise**
- Partner institution holds clinical responsibility

## Unicorn Path

| Year | Target | Revenue |
|------|--------|---------|
| Y1 | 50 nurse seats | ฿60M |
| Y2 | 200 seats | ฿240M |
| Y3 | 500 seats | ฿600M |
| Y5 | 4,000 seats | ฿4.8B |

**Exit**: 10x revenue = **$1.4B valuation**

## The Mantra

When in doubt, remember:

> **"10x nurse capacity through supervised AI"**

If a feature, message, or decision doesn't serve this, we don't do it.
