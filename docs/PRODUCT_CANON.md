## The Mission

> **Build the financial risk engine for capitation-based hospitals by continuously monitoring chronic patients via LINE, predicting deterioration before it becomes a complication, and converting unmanaged diabetes risk into measurable cost avoidance for mid-tier Thai NCD clinics.**

Everything we build, say, and measure serves this mission.

---

## What This Means

| Word | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Financial risk engine** | We save hospitals money by preventing complications they'd pay for under capitation |
| **Capitation-based** | SSS/UCS patients where the hospital eats the complication cost |
| **Continuously monitoring** | Daily LINE check-ins — not periodic clinic visits |
| **Predicting deterioration** | AI risk scoring catches problems 90 days earlier than the next clinic visit |
| **Measurable cost avoidance** | Every intervention tracked, every complication prevented has a ฿ value |
| **Mid-tier Thai NCD clinics** | Kasemrad, Thainakarin, Paolo — not Bumrungrad, not public hospitals |

---

## What We Are

- **Financial protection** for hospitals against preventable chronic complications
- **Between-visit monitoring** that fills the 90-day black hole after clinic visits
- **Exception detection** that tells nurses which patients need attention today
- **Supervised system** — AI flags, nurses decide, hospitals save

## What We Are NOT

- ❌ A replacement for nurses
- ❌ A telemedicine platform
- ❌ An EMR or patient app
- ❌ A medical device that diagnoses
- ❌ An autonomous decision-maker

## Core Value Proposition

| Buyer | Pain | Our Solution |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **VP Medical + CFO** | ฿2-4M/year lost to preventable complications under capitation | Pay ฿50K/month, avoid ฿700K+ in complication costs |
| **NCD Clinic Nurse** | 400 patients, paper follow-up book, no visibility between visits | Dashboard shows which 20-30 patients need attention today |
| **Patient** | Forgotten between visits, no one checks on them | Daily LINE check-in, feels cared for, stays engaged |

---

## Key Metrics (What We Measure)

| Metric | Before Hanna | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Patient visibility** (% of days with data) | 0% | >60% | Hospital can see patients between visits |
| **Intervention latency** (issue → clinical action) | 30-90 days | <24 hours | Problems caught before they become complications |
| **Follow-up attendance** | ~68% | >80% | Fewer patients disappearing |
| **Complications flagged early** | 0 | Track all | Each early flag = ฿175K complication avoided |
| **Cost avoided** | ฿0 | Calculate | CFO proof that Hanna pays for itself |

## Language Rules

### Always Say:

- "Complication prevention"
- "Financial protection"
- "Between-visit monitoring"
- "Cost avoidance"
- "Supervised care infrastructure"
- "Exception detection"

### Never Say:

- "AI Nurse" (sounds like replacement)
- "Virtual nurse" (regulatory risk)
- "10x nurse capacity" (old positioning — retired)
- "Autonomous" (implies no supervision)
- "Chatbot" (undervalues the product)
- "Diagnose" or "prescribe" (scope of practice violation)

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Your NCD clinic has 400 diabetic patients. After their visit, they disappear for 3 months. 54% come back still uncontrolled. Some come back with complications that cost you ฿175K each — and under capitation, you eat that cost.
>
> Hanna checks in with every patient daily via LINE. When something is wrong, your nurse gets alerted. You catch problems in 24 hours instead of 90 days.
>
> Pay ฿50,000 per month. Prevent 4 complications. Save ฿700,000."

## Pricing

| Model | Price | Structure |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Pilot** | ฿60,000/month | 3 months, auto-converts to annual |
| **Annual** | ฿50,000/month | Per NCD clinic, up to 500 patients |
| **Overage** | ฿100/patient/month | Beyond 500 patients |

---

## Regulatory Posture (Summary)

- Hanna is **infrastructure**, not a practitioner
- All clinical decisions by **licensed nurses**
- We **surface**, never **advise**
- Partner institution holds clinical responsibility

---

## Kill Criteria

If any 2+ of these signals fire during pilot, pause everything:

- Patient check-in rate <30%
- Hospital says "our nurses already do this"
- CFO shrugs at ROI math
- No auto-convert after 3 months

---

## The Mantra

When in doubt, remember:

> **"Build the financial risk engine for capitation-based hospitals."**

If a feature, message, or decision doesn't serve this, we don't do it.
