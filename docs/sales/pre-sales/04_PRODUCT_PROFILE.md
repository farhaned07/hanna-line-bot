# Hanna Product Profile
**The Financial Risk Engine for Capitation-Based NCD Clinics**

---

## Executive Overview
Hanna is a **financial risk engine** that closes the 90-day gap between clinic visits for chronic patients. By continuously monitoring patients via LINE and flagging deterioration before it becomes a complication, Hanna converts unmanaged diabetes risk into measurable cost avoidance — protecting hospitals from the financial exposure of capitation.

---

## The Challenge
**Under capitation (SSS/UCS), your hospital bears 100% of the financial risk for complications.**

1.  **The 90-Day Black Hole** — Between clinic visits, zero data on whether patients are adherent or deteriorating.
2.  **Reactive Detection** — Problems are only caught when patients return to the ER with DKA, hypertensive crisis, or worse.
3.  **Preventable Costs** — Each complication costs ฿175,000+. Under capitation, your hospital absorbs the loss.

**The Result:** Preventable admissions that destroy capitation margins.

## The Solution: Hanna
Hanna acts as a **financial protection layer** between clinic visits. It monitors patients daily and flags deterioration before it becomes a complication.

### 1. Patient Interface (LINE Bot)
*   **Zero-Friction Access**: Operates entirely within LINE. No new apps to download or learn.
*   **Structured Check-ins**: Daily button-based prompts for mood, medication, and symptoms.
*   **Voice-First Design**: Specialized Thai Voice AI (STT/TTS) allows elderly patients to speak naturally instead of typing.
*   **Gamification**: Streak celebrations (7/14/30 days) to drive long-term engagement.

### 2. Clinical Risk Engine (OneBrain™)
*   **Real-Time Scoring**: Every patient interaction is scored (0-10) based on vitals, symptoms, adherence, and behavioral patterns.
*   **Escalation Protocols**: Emergency keywords (e.g., "chest pain") trigger immediate "CRITICAL" alerts.
*   **Trend Detection**: Identifies deteriorating conditions (e.g., 3 days of rising blood pressure) before they become complications.

### 3. Nurse Command Center (Dashboard)
*   **Exception-Based Workflow**: Nurses see a prioritized queue of "At-Risk" patients only.
*   **One-Click Action**: Call or message patients directly from the dashboard.
*   **Full Context**: Instant access to conversation history, vital trends, and risk factors.
