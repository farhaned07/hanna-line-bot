# Hanna Product Profile
**Care That Scales Without Burning Out Nurses**

---

## Executive Overview
Hanna is a **supervised care intelligence platform** designed to solve the critical "post-discharge gap" in chronic disease management. By combining automated patient engagement with clinical risk scoring, Hanna allows a single nurse to safely monitor 500+ patients—transforming invisible home recovery into visible, actionable care.

---

## The Challenge
**Thailand faces a shortage of 50,000+ nurses.** Hospitals are overwhelmed, leading to:
1.  **Reactive Care** — Problems are only caught when patients return to the ER.
2.  **Nurse Burnout** — Clinical staff spend 40% of their time on administrative follow-up calls.
3.  **Invisible Decline** — No data on patient adherence or symptoms between visits.

**The Result:** Readmissions, complications, and exhausted staff.

## The Solution: Hanna
Hanna acts as a **force multiplier** for your nursing team. It does not replace nurses; it protects their time by automating routine monitoring and surfacing only clinically significant risks.

### 1. Patient Interface (LINE Bot)
*   **Zero-Friction Access**: Operates entirely within LINE. No new apps to download or learn.
*   **Structured Check-ins**: Daily button-based prompts for mood, medication, and symptoms.
*   **Voice-First Design**: Specialized Thai Voice AI (STT/TTS) allows elderly patients to speak naturally instead of typing.
*   **Gamification**: Streak celebrations (7/14/30 days) to drive long-term engagement.

### 2. Clinical Risk Engine (OneBrain™)
*   **Real-Time Scoring**: Every patient interaction is scored (0-10) based on vitals, symptoms, adherence, and behavioral patterns.
*   **Escalation Protocols**: Emergency keywords (e.g., "chest pain") trigger immediate "CRITICAL" alerts.
*   **Trend Detection**: Identifies deteriorating conditions (e.g., 3 days of rising blood pressure) before they become acute.

### 3. Nurse Command Center (Dashboard)
*   **Exception-Based Workflow**: Nurses see a prioritized queue of "At-Risk" patients only.
*   **One-Click Action**: Call or message patients directly from the dashboard.
*   **Full Context**: Instant access to conversation history, vital trends, and risk factors.
