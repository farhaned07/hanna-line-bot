# Hanna — The Risk Engine for Capitation-Based Follow-Up

---

## The Economics of the "Black Hole"

Under capitation (SSS/UCS), your hospital bears the financial risk for chronic patients.

When a diabetic patient leaves your NCD clinic, they enter a **90-day black hole**.
- **54%** come back uncontrolled.
- **10-15%** develop silent complications (foot ulcers, CKD progression) between visits.
- **Control is lost.** You only find out when they return—often too late.

**The Cost:** A single preventable foot ulcer or dialysis admission costs **฿175,000+**.
Under capitation, **you pay this bill.**

## The Solution: Financial Protection via Continuous Monitoring

Hanna is **supervised automated follow-up infrastructure** that closes the 90-day gap.

> **We check in daily. You catch complications early. You save the capitation loss.**

### How It Works (No App Required)

1.  **Daily LINE Check-in**: Hanna asks patients about vitals, symptoms, and meds via LINE.
2.  **Risk Scoring AI**: We analyze every answer for deterioration signals.
3.  **Exception Dashboard**: Your nurses see a **red list** of only the 5-10 patients who need help today.
4.  **Early Intervention**: Nurses call *before* the patient crashes.

## The Math: Protection vs. Cost

**Hanna costs ฿50,000 per month per clinic.**

If Hanna helps you prevent just **ONE** major complication (e.g., infected foot ulcer requiring debridement/admission) every 3 months:

| Item | Cost / Value |
|------|--------------|
| **Cost of Complication (Avoided)** | **+฿175,000** |
| Cost of Hanna (3 Months) | -฿150,000 |
| **Net Financial Gain** | **+฿25,000** |

*And that's just avoiding ONE case. What if you avoid five?*

## What We Are NOT

- ❌ **Not a replacement for nurses.** We help them prioritize the right patients.
- ❌ **Not "Telemedicine."** This is monitoring, not consultation.
- ❌ **Not an EMR.** We don't store medical records, we track risk.

## The Pilot: Prove the Protection

**90 Days to Validate Risk Reduction.**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Duration** | 90 days (auto-converts to annual if successful) |
| **Cohort** | Up to 500 chronic patients (Diabetes/Hypertension) |
| **Nurse Load** | <20 mins/day (handling exceptions only) |
| **Fee** | **฿60,000 / month** (credited back on annual contract) |
| **Goal** | >60% daily visibility, early detection of 5+ at-risk patients |

## Next Steps

1.  **Discovery Call (30 min)**: We map your specific NCD workflow.
2.  **Workflow Audit**: We identify your "black hole" risk points.
3.  **Pilot Launch**: We protect your first 500 patients.
