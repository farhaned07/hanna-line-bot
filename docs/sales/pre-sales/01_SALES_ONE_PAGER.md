# Hanna — Care That Scales Without Burning Out Nurses

---

## The Problem

Thailand is facing a growing nurse shortage. Hospitals cannot hire their way out of it.

**What this looks like on the ground:**

- Nurses overwhelmed with follow-ups, calls, and admin work
- Patients going silent between visits
- Missed medication, unmanaged symptoms
- No visibility into patient health once they leave the hospital

**Care stops after the visit. Problems show up too late.**

---

## The Solution

Hanna is supervised care infrastructure that helps nurses care for many more patients safely, without increasing workload.

> **Hanna handles daily patient follow-up.**  
> **Nurses focus only on what needs human attention.**

| What Hanna Does | How It Works |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Daily patient check-ins** | Automated follow-ups via LINE (no app needed) |
| **Medication reminders** | Simple, consistent prompts patients actually respond to |
| **Symptom monitoring** | Patients report vitals and symptoms every day |
| **Risk detection** | Hanna flags early warning signs automatically |
| **Nurse command center** | Nurses see a prioritized list of patients who need attention |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | AI assists. Nurses decide and act. |

*We don't replace nurses. We protect their time and attention.*
