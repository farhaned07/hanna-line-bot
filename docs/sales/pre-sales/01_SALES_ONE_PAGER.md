**10x Nurse Capacity through Supervised AI**

## The Problem

Thailand faces a shortage of **50,000+ nurses**. Hospitals cannot hire their way out.

**The result:**
- Burnout and staff turnover
- Missed follow-ups between clinic visits
- Preventable complications and readmissions
- No visibility into patient health outside the hospital

---

## The Solution

**Hanna** is supervised care infrastructure that lets **one nurse safely manage 500+ chronic patients**.

| What Hanna Does | How It Works |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Daily Patient Coverage** | Automated check-ins via **LINE** (no app download) |
| **Thai Voice AI** | Web Speech API (STT) + EdgeTTS Premwadee (TTS) for natural Thai conversations |
| **Risk Detection** | OneBrain™ scores every patient 0-10 in real-time |
| **Nurse Command Center** | Prioritized queue with Capacity Multiplier metric |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | AI surfaces exceptions; nurses decide and act |

> *"We don't replace nurses. We give them superpowers."*

---

## Why It's Safe

- **AI assists, never decides** — All clinical decisions remain with licensed staff
- **Clear escalation protocols** — Emergency keywords trigger immediate nurse alerts + 1669 referral
- **Full audit trail** — Every interaction logged for compliance and governance
- **Supervised infrastructure** — Not a medical device; not autonomous
