# Hanna Pilot ROI Summary
**Why ฿237K is a Strategic Investment, Not a Cost**

---

## The Investment

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Pilot Fee (90 days)** | ฿237,000 |

---

## The Return: Nurse Capacity Multiplier

### Current State (Without Hanna)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Patients per nurse (active management) | ~50 |
| Time spent on routine follow-up | ~40% of workday |
| Missed follow-ups per month | Unknown (no visibility) |
| Early warnings detected | Reactive (at next visit) |

### With Hanna (Pilot)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Patients per nurse | 200-500 |
| Time spent on routine follow-up | ~10% (AI handles rest) |
| Coverage rate | 100% (daily check-ins) |
| Early warnings detected | Real-time (risk scoring) |

## Financial Impact Analysis

### Scenario: 500-Patient Pilot

**Nurse Time Savings:**
- Current: 2 nurses × 40% time = 0.8 FTE on routine follow-up
- With Hanna: 2 nurses × 10% time = 0.2 FTE on routine follow-up
- **Time Freed:** 0.6 FTE for 90 days

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Nurse monthly cost (fully loaded) | ฿45,000 |
| 0.6 FTE for 3 months | ฿81,000 |
| **Pilot investment** | ฿237,000 |
| **Net cost of pilot** | ฿156,000 |

**But the real value is what nurses can now DO with that time:**
- More clinical consultations
- Better patient relationships
- Reduced burnout

### Prevented Readmissions (Conservative Estimate)

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Readmission rate (chronic patients) | ~15% annually |
| Cost per readmission | ฿50,000+ |
| If Hanna prevents 5 readmissions in 90 days | ฿250,000 saved |
| **Pilot investment** | ฿237,000 |
| **Net return from prevention alone** | +฿13,000 |

## Scaling Economics

If pilot succeeds, full deployment pricing:

| Scale | Patients | Monthly Fee | Cost per Patient |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Pilot | 500 | ฿237K (one-time) | ฿474/patient (pilot) |
| Growth | 2,000 | ฿99K/month | ฿50/patient/month |
| Scale | 8,000 | ฿149K/month | ฿19/patient/month |

**At scale, Hanna costs less than ฿20/patient/month.**

---

## Comparison: Hanna vs. Alternatives

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Hire more nurses | ฿45,000+/FTE | Not available (shortage) |
| Outsource call center | ฿30,000+/month | No clinical integration |
| Do nothing | ฿0 | Readmissions, burnout, liability |
| **Hanna (at scale)** | ฿19/patient | Supervised AI, full visibility |

---

## The Real ROI Question

> "What is the cost of NOT having visibility into 500 chronic patients between visits?"

- Missed deterioration → ER/readmission
- Medication non-adherence → Complications
- Nurse burnout → Staff turnover
- No data → No program improvement

**Hanna turns invisible risk into visible, actionable intelligence.**

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pilot Investment | ฿237,000 |
| Nurse time freed (90 days) | ~฿81,000 value |
| Potential readmissions prevented | 5+ (฿250,000+ value) |
| Scale pricing | ฿19/patient/month |
| **Payback period** | Within pilot |
