# Why Hanna Pays for Itself: The Financial Protection Case

---

## 1. The Cost of the "Black Hole"

Under capitation (SSS/UCS), your hospital is 100% liable for complications.
When a patient deteriorates between visits, you pay.

| Preventable Event | Direct Cost to Hospital | Who Pays? |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Infected Foot Ulcer** (Debridement/Admission) | **฿175,000+** | You |
| **Stroke (Rehab/Long-term)** | **฿300,000+** | You |
| **Starting Dialysis** (CKD Progression) | **฿500,000 / year** | You |
| **Uncontrolled HbA1c** (Medication Adjustment) | **฿5,000 / visit** | You |

> **One major complication costs more than 3 months of Hanna.**

## 2. The Solution: Financial Risk Engine

Hanna costs **฿50,000 / month** per clinic (up to 500 patients).
This is **฿100 / patient / month**.

### The Math: Avoiding Just ONE Case

If we monitor 500 patients for 3 months (Total cost: ฿150,000) and prevent **ONE** admitted foot ulcer:

- **Cost Avoided:** +฿175,000
- **Cost of Hanna:** -฿150,000
- **Net ROI:** **+฿25,000** (Positive loop)

*And this assumes only 1 event per 500 patients. In reality, 10-15% are at risk.*

## 3. Pilot Investment Structure

We structure the pilot to be **zero financial risk** for successful adopters.

| Item | Cost | Note |
|------|------|------|
| **Pilot (3 Months)** | ฿60,000 / month | Total: ฿180,000 |
| **Annual Contract** | ฿50,000 / month | Total: ฿600,000 |
| **Performance Credit** | **-฿180,000** | Full pilot fee credited back on annual sign |

> **If the pilot works and you continue, the pilot was effectively free.**

## 4. Why This is Better Than Hiring Nurses

| Option | Cost | Effectiveness for continuous monitoring? |
|--------|------|------------------------------------------|
| **Hire More Nurses** | ฿45,000 / nurse / month | **Low.** Humans can't call 500 patients daily. |
| **Call Center** | ฿30,000 / month | **Low.** No clinical context, purely scripted. |
| **Hanna** | ฿50,000 / month | **High.** 100% daily coverage. Risk-scored. |

## Summary

You are already paying for the "black hole" via complication costs.
**Hanna is simply a cheaper way to pay for that risk.**

- Pay ฿175,000 for a complication **after** it happens?
- Or pay ฿50,000 for Hanna to **prevent** it?

**The choice is financial.**
