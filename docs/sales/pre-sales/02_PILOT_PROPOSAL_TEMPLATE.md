# Hanna Pilot Proposal
**[Hospital Name]**

---

## Executive Summary

Hanna is a supervised care intelligence platform designed to extend nurse capacity for chronic disease management. This proposal outlines a 90-day pilot program to demonstrate measurable improvements in patient engagement, medication adherence, and nurse efficiency.

**Investment:** ฿237,000 (one-time pilot fee)  
**Duration:** 90 days (12 weeks)  
**Patient Cohort:** 500-1,000 chronic patients

---

## 1. The Opportunity

Your chronic care program currently relies on manual phone calls and LINE messages to follow up with patients between visits. This approach is:

- Labor-intensive (consuming ~40% of nurse time)
- Inconsistent (some patients receive more attention than others)
- Reactive (issues detected at the next appointment, not in real-time)

**Hanna addresses all three constraints.**

## 2. What Hanna Delivers

### For Patients
- Daily check-ins via **LINE** (the app they already use)
- **Thai Voice AI** (Web Speech API + EdgeTTS Premwadee) for elderly patients
- Medication reminders and encouragement
- 24/7 availability for symptom reporting

### For Nurses
- **Dashboard** showing only patients who need attention today
- **Risk scores (0-10)** prioritizing outreach
- One-click call or message directly from dashboard
- Time saved on routine follow-up → Focus on clinical work

### For Hospital Leadership
- Real-time visibility into program health
- Measurable outcomes (adherence, engagement, early interventions)
- ROI data for scale-up decisions
