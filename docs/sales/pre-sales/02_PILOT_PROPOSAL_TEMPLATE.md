# Pilot Proposal: Financial Risk Engine for NCD Management

**Prepared for:** [Hospital Name]
**Date:** [Date]

## Executive Summary: Closing the 90-Day Black Hole

Currently, when a chronic patient leaves your NCD clinic, they enter a **90-day visibility gap**.
- **Risk:** Deterioration happens here, unseen.
- **Cost:** Complications (foot ulcers, CKD, strokes) develop here.
- **Impact:** Under capitation, your hospital pays for these preventable events.

**Hanna is the financial risk engine that closes this gap.**
We provide daily, supervised monitoring via LINE to detect deterioration *before* it becomes a complication.

## The Pilot: Prove the Value

This 90-day pilot is designed to demonstrate one thing: **Financial Protection.**

### Core Objectives
1.  **Visibility:** Achieve >60% daily patient response rate.
2.  **Detection:** Identify at-risk patients *before* their next scheduled visit.
3.  **Prevention:** Enable early nurse intervention for identified risks.

### Pilot Scope
- **Duration:** 3 Months (Auto-converts to annual if targets met)
- **Cohort:** Up to 500 patients (Diabetes/Hypertension)
- **Technology:** Hanna LINE Bot + Nurse Exception Dashboard
- **Staffing:** Your existing NCD nurse team (handling <5-10 exceptions/day)

| **Pilot Fee (3 Months)** | **฿60,000 / month** |
| **Setup & Training** | Included |
| **Total Pilot Cost** | **฿180,000** |

> **Performance Guarantee:** If you sign an annual contract at the end of the pilot, the full pilot fee (฿180,000) is credited toward your first year.

### Annual Pricing (Post-Pilot)
- **Fee:** ฿50,000 / month / clinic
- **Capacity:** Up to 500 active patients
- **Overage:** ฿100 / patient / month

## ROI: The Cost of Doing Nothing

Why invest ฿180,000 in a pilot? **To save millions in capitation losses.**

| Scenario | Cost to Hospital |
|----------|------------------|
| **1 Preventable Foot Ulcer (Admitted)** | ~฿175,000 |
| **1 Stroke Rehab Case** | ~฿300,000 |
| **1 CKD Progression (Dialysis start)** | ~฿500,000+/year |

**If Hanna helps you prevent just ONE of these events during the pilot, the system has paid for itself.**

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Discovery (Week 0)**
- Map current NCD workflow & pain points.
- Select patient cohort criteria (e.g., uncontrolled HbA1c > 8).

**Phase 2: Launch (Week 1-2)**
- Nurse training (1 hour).
- Patient onboarding (QR Code at clinic).

**Phase 3: Operation (Week 3-12)**
- Daily automated monitoring acts as the "safety net."
- Weekly data review: "What did we catch?"

**Phase 4: Review (Week 12)**
- Operational Report: Engagement %, Interventions made.
- ROI Calculation: Estimated costs avoided.
- Decision: Scale or Stop.

## Next Steps

1.  **Discovery Session:** 30 minutes to look at your "black hole" data.
2.  **Cohort Selection:** Pick the 500 patients causing the most sleep loss.
3.  **Green Light:** Sign pilot agreement & begin protection.
