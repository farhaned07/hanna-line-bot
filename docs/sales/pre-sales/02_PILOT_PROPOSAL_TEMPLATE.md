# Hanna Pilot Proposal

**[Hospital Name]**

---

## Executive Summary

Hanna is a supervised care intelligence platform designed to support safe scale in chronic disease management. This proposal outlines a 90-day pilot program to demonstrate improvements in patient engagement, medication adherence, and nurse efficiency—without changing existing clinical authority or workflows.

**Pilot Cost:** ฿79,000/month × 3 months = ฿237,000  
**Duration:** 90 days (12 weeks)  
**Patient Cohort:** Up to 1,000 chronic patients (phased enrollment)

---

## 1. The Opportunity

Chronic care follow-up today relies heavily on manual phone calls and ad-hoc LINE messages. This creates three persistent constraints:

- **High nurse workload** spent on routine follow-ups
- **Inconsistent patient coverage** between visits
- **Late detection of issues** once patients return to clinic

As patient volumes grow, this model does not scale.

Hanna is designed to work with your existing nurses and workflows—supporting continuity of care without adding staff or disrupting delivery.

## 2. What Hanna Delivers

### For Patients

- Daily check-ins via LINE (no new app required)
- Natural Thai voice and chat interactions, suitable for elderly patients
- Medication reminders and daily encouragement
- Simple symptom and vitals reporting outside clinic hours

### For Nurses

- A single dashboard showing only patients who need attention
- Risk prioritization to guide outreach
- One-click call or message with full patient context
- Less routine chasing, more clinical focus

### For Hospital Leadership

- Visibility into patient care between visits
- Clear operational metrics (engagement, adherence, interventions)
- Evidence to support scale-up decisions
