## Pitch Deck Guidelines

### Slide: What Is Hanna?

**Use:**
> "Hanna is dedicated care coordination infrastructure that provides the capacity of a full-time care coordinator — available 24/7, always supervised by your clinical team."

**Avoid:**
> "Hanna is an AI nurse that works for your hospital."

---

### Slide: ROI

**Frame the comparison as capacity, not software:**

| Investment | Monthly Cost | Availability | Supervision |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 FTE Care Coordinator | ฿25,000+ | 8 hrs/day | Manager oversight |
| **Hanna Deployment** | **฿599** | **24/7** | **Nurse-supervised** |

**Never say:** "Cheaper than hiring" (implies replacement)  
**Say instead:** "Capacity at a fraction of staffing costs"

---

## Crisis Response Language

If challenged by regulators, unions, or press:

**Position Statement:**
> "Hanna is supervised care infrastructure designed to extend — not replace — clinical staff. Every patient interaction occurs under nurse oversight, and Hanna escalates any situation requiring clinical judgment to human staff immediately. Hanna does not diagnose, prescribe, or make independent clinical decisions."

---

## Summary: The Asymmetric Positioning

**Buyers think:** "This gives me employee-like capacity at infrastructure prices."  
**Regulators see:** "This is supervised infrastructure, not a practitioner."  
**Nurses feel:** "This helps me, doesn't threaten me."

That asymmetry is the win.
