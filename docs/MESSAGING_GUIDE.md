| Context | Use This |
|---------|----------|
| **What Hanna Is** | "Financial risk engine for NCDs" |
| | "Supervised complication prevention system" |
| | "Continuous monitoring infrastructure" |
| **What Hanna Does** | "Closes the 90-day visibility gap" |
| | "Detects deterioration early" |
| | "Surfaces exceptions to nurses" |
| | "Converts unmanaged risk into managed care" |
| **Pricing Anchor** | "Cost of prevention vs. cost of complication" |

### ❌ PROHIBITED Language

| Never Say | Why It's Dangerous |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **"Hire Hanna"** | Implies employment, low-value labor replacement |
| **"Your AI Nurse"** | Triggers scope-of-practice scrutiny, suggests independent practice |
| **"10x Nurse Capacity"** | Old positioning. Sounds like "we will fire nurses." |
| **"Works independently"** | Suggests unsupervised clinical decisions |
| **"Diagnoses" / "Prescribes"** | Regulatory violation. Only doctors do this. |
| **"Autonomous care"** | Implies no human oversight |
| **"Chatbot"** | Sounds cheap and dumb. Hanna is a risk engine. |

## Crisis Response Language

If challenged by regulators or press:

**Position Statement:**
> "Hanna is non-clinical infrastructure designed to surface patient data to licensed medical professionals. It does not diagnose, treat, or prescribe. All clinical decisions are made by the hospital's existing medical team. Hanna simply ensures they have the data to make those decisions in time."

## Summary: The Shift

**Old Pitch:** "We help your nurses do more." (Efficiency)
**New Pitch:** "We stop you from losing money on complications." (Financial Protection)

**Efficiency is a nice-to-have. Financial protection is a must-have.**
