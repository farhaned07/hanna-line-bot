# Hanna: 10x Nurse Capacity through Supervised AI

---

## The Problem

Thailand faces a shortage of **35,000 nurses**. Hospitals cannot hire their way out.

The result:
- Burnout and turnover
- Missed follow-ups between clinic visits
- Preventable readmissions and complications

---

## The Solution

**Hanna** is supervised care infrastructure that lets **one nurse safely manage 500+ chronic patients**.

| Capability | How It Works |
|------------|--------------|
| **Daily Patient Coverage** | Automated check-ins via **LINE** & **Thai Voice AI** |
| **Risk Detection** | OneBrain™ engine scores every patient 0-10 in real-time |
| **Nurse Command Center** | Prioritized queue showing who needs a call *right now* |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | AI surfaces exceptions; nurses decide and act |

> *"We don't replace nurses. We give them superpowers."*

## Technology

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| AI Reasoning | Groq Llama 3.3 70B |
| Voice (Thai) | Microsoft EdgeTTS (Premwadee voice) |
| Patient Interface | LINE Messaging API, LIFF Voice |
| Dashboard | React + Tailwind (Vercel) |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL |

All interactions are logged for audit and research.

## Regulatory Posture

Hanna is **infrastructure**, not a practitioner.

- All clinical decisions remain with licensed staff
- Patients are informed they are interacting with an AI assistant
- Emergency keywords trigger immediate human escalation (1669 referral)

|---------|---------|
| **Duration** | 3-6 months |
| **Cohort** | 100-500 chronic patients (diabetes, hypertension) |
| **Metrics** | Nurse time saved, patient engagement rate, risk detection accuracy |
| **Integration** | LINE bot + Nurse dashboard (no EMR integration required) |
